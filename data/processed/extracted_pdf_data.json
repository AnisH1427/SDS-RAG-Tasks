In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements\nreflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. These condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\u00a025, 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\nthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d\n\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\u00a025, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Form 10-K\u201d) under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\nperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\n\u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance matters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form\n10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\ndollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air  and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro , both powered by the new\nApple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS  Ventura, iPadOS  16 and watchOS  9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\navailable in the fall of 2022.\nThe Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 14\n",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on\nforeign earnings and an adjustment to prior years\u2019 foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the first nine months of\n2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based\ncompensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and\ncontinued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June\u00a025, 2022, the\nCompany had manufacturing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\nobligations are primarily noncancelable.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the \u201cProgram\u201d). The\nProgram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June\u00a025, 2022, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per\nshare. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company\u2019s discussion\nand analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the\namounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and\nmethods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s\ncritical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.\nItem 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to market\nrisk, refer to the Company\u2019s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d of the 2021 Form\n10-K.\nItem 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) were effective as of June\u00a025, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\u00a0recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\u00a0 accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 19\n",

(\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cNorthern California District Court\u201d) against the\nCompany alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company\u2019s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\nItem 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, can be affected by a number of\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d When any\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of\nthe Company\u2019s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K.\nItem 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nShare repurchase activity during the three months ended June\u00a025, 2022 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands,\nand per share amounts):\nPeriods\nTotal Number\nof Shares\nPurchased\nAverage Price\nPaid Per\nShare\nTotal Number of\nShares\nPurchased as Part\nof Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nPrograms\nApproximate Dollar\nValue of\nShares That May Yet Be\nPurchased\nUnder the Plans or\nPrograms \nMarch 27, 2022 to April 30, 2022:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n50,578\u00a0\n$\n168.06\u00a0\n50,578\u00a0\nMay 1, 2022 to May 28, 2022:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n42,069\u00a0\n$\n148.45\u00a0\n42,069\u00a0\nMay 29, 2022 to June 25, 2022:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n50,027\u00a0\n$\n139.06\u00a0\n50,027\u00a0\nTotal\n142,674\u00a0\n$\n85,877\u00a0\n(1)\nOn April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $90\u00a0 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock under the Program. As of\nJune\u00a025, 2022, total utilization under the April 2022 authorization was $4.1 billion. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company also utilized the final $17.6\nbillion under the $90 billion Program authorization approved in April 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.\nUnder the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1\nunder the Exchange Act.\n(1)\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 20\n",
